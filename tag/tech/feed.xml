      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4444/blog/why-I-transit-from-SE-to-research">&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently transited from working as a software engineer in a technology startups to a research assistant (RA) in electrical engineering. People are often interested and even surprised in my transition from working in the tech industry to academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are you going to adjust between the research work and latest technology in the industry? How do you find the pay between a software engineer and a research assistant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have faced similar questions and doubts at the time I made the decision. In the hindsight, it made perfect sense for me to go back to school and pick up research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re in similar situation, deciding whether to go back to school from working in the industry. I’d suggest you to really ask yourself why and list down the reasons why you think you should whether go back to academia or stay in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are five reasons why I went back to the academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pursue-your-interests&quot;&gt;Pursue your interests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is obvious and a very important one. Interest in conducting innovative research on a specific domain should be the number one why you choose working on research instead of working in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have a passion in the fields of machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. And at that time, I want to devote more time to manifest my interests in designing and implementing machine learning and deep learning and I believe working on research with my supervisor provide me with the opportunity to pursue my interests with full concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping back to the academia may seem to be a risky decision for some people, especially for those who have worked in the industry for a while. But you never know what you like / dislike unless you have tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the opportunity cost for me to get back to research at this stage of my life is much lower than someone in their late twenties/ thirties to do so. Hence, if you have the time and cost, my advice is to follow your passion and go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-more-research-opportunities&quot;&gt;Get more research opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A software engineer is a technical position in an organisation. The main job is to achieve the organisation’s goals with skills in coding, implementing algorithms, building system architecture etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas a research assistant (in EE / CS) is to continuously develop domain expertise in an area of interest and translate research into publications, codes and result with academic values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I want to prepare myself for my master’s study as well as research-oriented jobs (such as research scientist, research engineer). Hence, I opt for taking some time to work in the research of my interest before starting my master’s study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;change-career-fields&quot;&gt;Change career fields&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To transit from one career field to another, getting into research can be a gateway to widen your career choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump directly from one career field to another with neither previous working experience nor education background in a particular field can sometimes be hard. Imagine a software engineer in a medical technology company who want to transit into a director of Medical Informatics, there may be a gap to bridge. Especially the latter one may require knowledge in informatics and organisational management skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparatively, it may be easier to obtain research opportunity in a multidisciplinary field, say biomedical informatics given your previous background is in computer science. With the research experience in a new field, one can obtain new domain expertises and skillsets that allow one to explore broader career choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;further-your-studies&quot;&gt;Further your studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a research assistant can be a stepping stone for furthering study as a Master’s / PhD student. It is common for perspective Master’s / PhD student to work with their potential supervisor as a RA prior to their start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one side, you can get to know the professor and the research center and increase the chance continuing working with the professor - be it PhD student or on-campus RA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, it can be an opportunity to see whether there is a good chemistry between you and your supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;want-freedom--flexibility&quot;&gt;Want freedom &amp;amp; flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academia is a great environment for researches whereas industry is driven mostly by revenue and results related to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the bright sides of being a research assistant is that you can enjoy a higher level of control over your projects. As a research assistant, I have more time and resources devoted to projects in an area of interest to me, which is usually not the case in companies and organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a higher flexibility in term of the style fo work. I have the freedom to decide my types of work, where to place, who to work with and when to work etc as a research staff in academic as long as I produce satisfactory result to my supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, freedom and flexibility comes with responsibility and discipline. Otherwise, it can be adversely affect your research productivity and work ethnics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this article has provided you with insights if you are considering into getting back to research as a software engineer. Thanks for reading! If you have any questions or suggestions, please leave a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea of starting a personal blog has been swirling around my head for some time, and I think the best way to shut it down is to create one.

### There are a few things that you should know up-front:
1. Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best for. If you're using Ghost for some other purpose, that's fine too - but it might not be the best choice for you.
2. The entire platform can be modified and customized to suit your needs, which is very powerful, but doing so **does** require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.
3. For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device.


Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our [Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing) service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern journalism.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [the Ghost editor](https://demo.ghost.io/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts! --&gt;</content>
